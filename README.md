## Social Focus

**TLDR;** This application renders a visualization of a live stream of data from two social networks.

The purpose of this application is to produce a quick visual analysis of trends in social media platforms by calculating the differences in the number of posts over time. By allowing users to see how their social media networks preform in real time, users can gain a sense of their campaign success and quickly pivot strategies to optimize success.

### Refactor:
I am currently refactoring the visual display to portray a scale range, which will depict the flow of positive and negative data trends in real time.
